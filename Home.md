# Getting Started
There are a couple of hard dependencies:
* Spigot/Paper [Protocol Lib](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/1997/)
* Bungeecord/Waterfall [Protocolize](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/63778/)

Whilst it's not mandatory it's highly suggested that you get a permissions plugin for example Luckperms or PermissionsEX to unlock the full potential of the plugin.<br/><br/>Installing the plugin is really simple:
* If you have a Spigot/Paper server, put the plugin in that folder.
* If you have a Bungeecord/Waterfall server, install the plugin there only, you shouldn't put it in the spigot/paper servers.

# I found a BUG!
