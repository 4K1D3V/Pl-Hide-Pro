# Getting Started
Whilst it's not mandatory it's highly suggested that you get a permissions plugin for example Luckperms or PermissionsEX to unlock the full potential of the plugin.<br/><br/>If you have a spigot/paper server, put the plugin in that folder.<br/>If you have a bungeecord/waterfall server, install the plugin there, and the spigot/paper servers you own.<br/>If you have vanilla, I don't know how you managed to get a single plugin!
