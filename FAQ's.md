# Groups
Q: **How do I use Groups?**


A:
``` 
  groupName:
    commands:
     - command1
     - command2
    group-mode-commands: whitelist/blacklist
    tabcomplete:
     - command1
     - command2
    group-mode-tabcomplete: whitelist/blacklist
    priority: 0
    included-groups:
     - group1
```

Each group needs a different **groupname**.

The "**commands**" **section** lists the commands that can either be blocked or executed exclusively. List subcommads is also possible:

Example1 (**blacklist**): If you list "cmd test" it will block "cmd test" and its subargs ("cmd test <args>"), but it will not block "cmd" or "cmd help"

Example2 (**whitelist**): If you list "cmd test" it will block "cmd" and "cmd help", but it will not block "cmd test" or "cmd test <args>".


The "**tabcomplete**" section lists the commands that are either be removed or only visible in the tabcompletion. List subtabcompletions is also possible:


Example1 (**blacklist**): If you list "cmd test" it will remove the subarg "test" and its subargs but not "cmd" itself. So "cmd help" will be visible.


Example2 (**whitelist**): If you list "cmd test" it will remove all subargs except "test" and its subargs but not "cmd" itself. So "cmd help" not be visible


The boolean **group-mode-commands** and **group-mode-tabcomplete** decides whether the list is a blacklist or whitelist, and should be used respectively e.g. group-mode-commands: blacklist

In the "**included-groups**" section you can add other groups (The group type of the inherited groups is that of the parent group).
The commands and tab completion from the "included groups" will be added to this group. Note that the implemented groups **implement their implemented groups**!â€‹

Q: **How do I give a group access to another/multiple groups?**


A: You'll need to assign every group under "included-groups:". Meaning if you have ranks e.g.Admin, Moderator and Default, this is how you'd assign 2 groups to the group Admin:
```  
  Admin:
    commands:
      - ban
    group-mode-commands: whitelist
    tabcomplete:
      - ban
    group-mode-tabcomplete: whitelist
    priority: 20
    included-groups:
      - default
      - Moderator
```
**Note that groups are inherited recursively**. For example, if moderator also includes default, you don't have to inherit default for the Admin group as well.

Q: **How do my players get pl-hide group permissions?**


A: By default everyone gets the group "default" regardless of whether you assign it or not. Otherwise, you need to add the permission for example "**plhide.group.test**" to apply the group "Test". Be sure to not get confused with "pl-hide.group.test" as this could lead to failure.

***

Q: **What is a ```group mode```?**

A:If a group should block commands and remove these commands from the tab completion, set group-mode to blacklist.

Otherwise if group-mode is set to whitelist, only the listed commands will be executable and all not listed commands will be removed from the tabcomplete

***

~~Q:**What is the operator ```~```?**~~

~~A:The operator ~ only works with whitelists
Examples:~~

~~If you list "help ~" in the command list, /help can only be executed without its subarguments, "/ help ?" can't be executed.~~

~~If you list "help ~" in the "tabcomplete" list, /help is displayed without its subarguments, "/ help ?" will not be visible.~~

***

~~Q: **Can I add all commands of a plugin?**~~

~~A: Yes. Just add for example ```- plugin:WorldEdit``` to your list
If you use Bungeecord you have to install the plugin on each MC server with bungee-mode to true.
Note you can't list Bungeecord plugins, because it's not possible to find out which plugin has registered a command~~

***

Q: **My groups aren't being set correctly, how do I check what permission group has what plhide group?**

A: Use the ```debug: true``` section in the config.yml. Reload the plugin so it will show you where each group is being set. The debug log is located in the plhide folder.

# Commands
Q: **How do i add worldedit commands?**

A: There's a common misconception that adding ```- /``` will work. It isn't going to work because that isn't a command. Instead use ```- /wand``` as an example.
