# Groups
Q: **How do I use Groups?**<br/><br/>
A:
``` 
  groupName:
    commands:
     - command1
     - command2
    should-list-block1: true/false
    tabcomplete:
     - command1
     - command2
    should-list-block2: true/false
    priority: 0
    included-groups:
     - group1
```

Each group needs a different **groupname**.

The "**commands**" **section** lists the commands that can either be blocked or executed exclusively. List subcommads is also possible:<br/>
Example1 (**blacklist**): If you list "cmd test" it will block "cmd test" and its subargs ("cmd test <args>"), but it will not block "cmd" or "cmd help"<br/>
Example2 (**whitelist**): If you list "cmd test" it will block "cmd" and "cmd help", but it will not block "cmd test" or "cmd test <args>".


The "**tabcomplete**" section lists the commands that are either be removed or only visible in the tabcompletion. List subtabcompletions is also possible:<br/><br/>
Example1 (**blacklist**): If you list "cmd test" it will remove the subarg "test" and its subargs but not "cmd" itself. So "cmd help" will be visible.<br/><br/>
Example2 (**whitelist**): If you list "cmd test" it will remove all subargs except "test" and its subargs but not "cmd" itself. So "cmd help" not be visible


The boolean **should-list block** decides whether the list is a blacklist or whitelist (**true=blacklist false=whitelist**)

In the "**included-groups**" section you can add other groups (The group type of the inherited groups is that of the parent group).
The commands and tabcompletion from the "included groups" will be added to this group. Note that the implemented groups **don't implement their implemented groups**!â€‹

Q: **How do I give a group access to another/multiple groups?**<br/><br/>
A: You'll need to assign every group under "included-groups:". Meaning if you have ranks e.g.Admin, Moderator and Default, this is how you'd assign 2 groups to the group Admin:
```  
  Admin:
    commands:
      - ban
    should-list-block1: false
    tabcomplete:
      - ban
    should-list-block2: false
    priority: 20
    included-groups:
      - default
      - Moderator
```

Q: **How do my players get pl-hide group permissions?**


A: By default everyone gets the group "default" regardless of whether you assign it or not. Otherwise, you need to add the permission for example "**plhide.group.test**" to apply the group "Test". Be sure to not get confused with "pl-hide.group.test" as this could lead to failure.

***

Q: **What is ```Should-list-block```?**

A:If a group should block commands and remove these commands from the tab completion, set should-list-block to true.

Otherwise if should-list-block is set to false, only the listed commands will be executable and all not listed commands will be removed from the tabcomplete

***

Q:**What is the operator ```~```?**

A:The operator ~ only works with whitelists
Examples:
If you list "help ~" in the command list, /help can only be executed without its subarguments, "/ help ?" can't be executed.

If you list "help ~" in the "tabcomplete" list, /help is displayed without its subarguments, "/ help ?" will not be visible.

# Different servers
Q: **How do I give a permission group access to different pl-hide commands across different servers?**

A: You'll need to create different pl-hide groups on the different servers and on the bungeecord server.

Let's say you have a rank "vip" and a creative and survival server. You would need to create 2 different vip groups in the bungeecord server, e.g."vip-Creative" and "vip-Survival", making sure that whatever you put in the bungeecord group, is mirrored across the different servers.<br/>Also if you haven't already realised, you'll need to give the permission group access to both bungee pl-hide groups and for the servers, e.g. "plhide.group.vip-Creative","plhide.group.vip-Survival" and "plhide.group.vip".

# Commands
Q: **How do i add worldedit commands?**

A: There's a common misconception that adding ```- /``` will work. It isn't going to work because that isn't a command. Instead use ```- /wand`` as an example.
