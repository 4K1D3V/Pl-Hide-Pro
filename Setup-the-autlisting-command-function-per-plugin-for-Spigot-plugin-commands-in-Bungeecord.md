* Enable the bungee-mode in the Bungee config.yml of Pl-Hide-Pro 
* Reload PlHide-Pro with /plhide-bungee rl
* Install Pl-Hide-Pro on each subserver (_although it's mentioned otherwise on the startpage!_)
* Copy the secret.key from the Pl-Hide-Pro folder on the Bungeeplugin into each Pl-Hide-Pro folder on the sub-servers
* Enable the bungee-mode in the Spigot config.yml of Pl-Hide-Pro and enter the IP from the **Bungeecord** server 
* Reload Pl-Hide-Pro-Spigot with /plhide rl

Now `plugin:<pluginName>` should work for all Spigot plugins in Bungee config.yml of my plugin
