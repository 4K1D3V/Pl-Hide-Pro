## Groupname

Each group needs a different **groupname**.

To add a specific group to a user, add the permission **plhide.group.{groupname}**. If a player has **2 groups** permissions, then the group is set depending on the **priority** (the higher the number, the higher the priority)
With the Bungeecord plugin you can choose on which servers the groups should be applied.

## Commands

The "**commands**" **section** lists the commands that can either be blocked or executed exclusively. List subcommads is also possible:

Example1 (**blacklist**): If you list "cmd test" it will block "cmd test" and its subargs ("cmd test <args>"), but it will not block "cmd" or "cmd help"

Example2 (**whitelist**): If you list "cmd test" it will block "cmd" and "cmd help", but it will not block "cmd test" or "cmd test <args>".

## Tabcomplete

The "**tabcomplete**" section lists the commands that are either be removed or only visible in the tabcompletion. List subtabcompletions is also possible:


Example1 (**blacklist**): If you list "cmd test" it will remove the subarg "test" and its subargs but not "cmd" itself. So "cmd help" will be visible.


Example2 (**whitelist**): If you list "cmd test" it will remove all subargs except "test" and its subargs but not "cmd" itself. So "cmd help" not be visible

## Groupmode

The group mode decides whether the list is a blacklist or whitelist. By **default** the group mode is **whitelist**. If you want to change it to blacklist, you have to give the player a permission:
For the commands it's **plhide.blacklist.commands** and for the tabcomplete it's **plhide.blacklist.tabcomplete**

## Server

If you are using the Bungeecord plugin, there is another list called **servers**. Here you add the server names on which the group can only be inherited or applied. 
The default value is "all".

## Inheritance

In the "**included-groups**" section you can add other groups (The group type of the inherited groups is that of the parent group).
The commands and tab completion from the "included groups" will be added to this group. Note that the implemented groups **implement their implemented groups**!â€‹
So the inheritance is recursive means: if you have, for example, 3 groups: Default, Moderator, Admin. Moderator inherits from Default and Admin inherits from Moderator, then Admin also inherits the Default group, since Moderator inherits it 

**The group modes are always be taken from the parent group**

Example group:
``` 
  groupName:
    commands:
     - command1
     - command2
    group-mode-commands: whitelist/blacklist
    tabcomplete:
     - command1
     - command2
    group-mode-tabcomplete: whitelist/blacklist
    priority: 0
    included-groups:
     - group1
```
